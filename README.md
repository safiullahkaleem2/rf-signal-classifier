# RF Signal Classifier

A machine learning project that simulates and classifies radio frequency (RF) signals using a convolutional neural network (CNN). This project generates AM, FM, and noise signals, converts them into spectrograms, and trains a model to distinguish between them.

## Features

- Simulates synthetic RF signals (AM, FM, and Noise)
- Converts raw IQ signals into spectrograms
- Trains a CNN to classify signal types
- Includes data augmentation and validation
- Clean project structure for reproducibility
